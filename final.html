			<h2> Racial Disparities Evident In New York City </h2>

			<h3>The Problem</h3>

			<p id="with-element">There is recent data from New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services (NYS DCJS) that highlights the racial disparities that continue to plague our criminal justice system, and there is room for question regarding whether or not the arrests are racially motivated. The data sheds light on the amount of crimes committed from 2016-2018, and the amount of criminals arrested in a particular race in New York City.</p>
			<p>Racial and ethnic disparities are common, yet extremely controversial because there is reasonable public doubt as to whether these arrests are justified or racially motivated. It’s the role of the prosecutor to give their recommendation for the future of a case, in screening, charging, bail, and pretrial detention, along with diversion, plea bargaining, and sentencing.</p>

			<h3>Findings</h3>
			<p>A research study supported by the National Institute of Justice was published to take a further look within the statistics, and investigate the prosecutorial discretion that has a voice within the fate of a case. The question of whether or not race and ethnicity had a say in the disparate outcomes.</p>
			<p>“Analysis of all misdemeanor drug offenses found that black defendants were 27 percent and Latino defendants 18 percent more likely to receive a custodial sentence offer (which included time served in pretrial detention as an offer), as compared to similarly situated white defendants”</p><p>LThe study showed that Black and Latinos who were faced with misdemeanor drug offenses, were more likely to receive options ranging from punitive plea offers to custodial sentences. Those of Asian descent who were defendants of misdemeanors, were found to be the least likely to be faced with detention, recipients of custodial offers, or incarceration.</p>
			<p>While this study was done in 2010, fast-forwarding through the years to 2016-2018, findings from the NYS DCJS show that when comparing the number of arrested Black defendants to White defendants, there is more than a 100% larger population of Black defendants that overpowers the White population. Within the three years there were over 78,00 Black arrests and 20,000 White arrests.</p><p>It was found that 93% of the people arrested by the NYPD for marijuana possession in January-March of 2018 were minorities. Of the 4,081 arrests for criminal possession of marijuana, only 287 of those arrested were white people, compared to 2,006 black people and 1,621 Latino people.</p>

			<h3>Interview</h3>
			<p id="with-element">When speaking about racial disparity and the potential effect it may have on enhancing injustice, what are your initial thoughts on the racial disparity for New York City specifically?</p>
			<div id="list">
				<h4>List of Disparities In Order</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Black</li>
					<li>Hispanic</li>
					<li>White</li>
					<li>Asian/Indian</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p id="with-element">"If minorities are producing the most crimes I wouldn’t say it has to do with their race. The crimes depend on the area and the reason why people are committing these crimes. It’s not racial disparity, it’s a matter of population and circumstances. Is it a struggling parent who doesn’t know where their next meal is coming from and that’s why minorities rank high on stealing misdemeanors, or is it generational poverty and all that’s all they know?”</p>
			<p id="with-element">Do you believe the affluence in New York City (that is particularly dominated by white people) has any effect on the city’s poverty rate and that’s the reason minorities tend to be arrested for crimes such as that?
ho doesn’t know where their next meal is coming from and that’s why minorities rank high on stealing misdemeanors, or is it generational poverty and all that’s all they know?” </p><p id="with-element">"People who are well off commit different crimes. They won’t be the ones committing shoplifting, boosting, drugs, etc. It will be high profile crimes such as money laundering, and the individuals who live in the middle to poverty levels see crime as an opportunity to survive. I.e. Robbing as a sort of necessity."</p>
			<p id="with-element">What’s your opinion on the drug epidemic and why do you think black people seem to be targeted more than any other race between 2016-2018—a time when weed was not as legal as today, even though drugs are bought and sold by all types of people?
</p><p id="with-element">"Minorities are the ones who get caught up in their neighborhood. If you smoke in your apartment nobody’s going to complain but once you start doing it near school grounds, on playgrounds, where families are attending, then an arrest is more likely because people are going to complain and you are more likely to get caught. Again if you say black people are getting arrested for it more than a white person, it’s because they are doing it somewhere visual where they can get arrested."</p>
			<p id="with-element">So as far as racial disparity, what would you say to the people saying it’s a target on minorities in particular, black people?</p><p id="with-element">“You have to look at the majority of the population in New York City overall. It’s a mix of ethnicities and if you look, again, at a particular location, in my entire career I’ve arrested maybe 4 people of Asian descent. It’s not a race problem, it’s the fact that marginalized groups tend to stick together in a common neighborhood and some cultures don’t have a community for them; So the population of that race decreases by default. Some crimes are more common based on a similar upbringing. But that’s a completely different issue at hand. You go to the South Bronx vs Throgs Neck and the crime rate is completely different, but it’s all the same Bronx. I would say the affluence of someone should be taken into consideration and whether or not race is affected by that affluence is another discussion.”</p>
			<p id="with-element">What about people who commit the same crime regardless of race? For example sexual assault or drunk driving?</p><p id="with-element">“People are now becoming more comfortable committing crimes. The change of laws have allowed people to carry illegal firearms. The no-bear reform allows you to commit a serious crime and still be released without bail only to be free to do the crime again. Everyone is affected.”</p><p id="with-element">As a person who’s in the system as NYPD, what would you say is the majority of the ethnicities that make up police in New York City? 
</p><p id="with-element">"Right now believe it or not, the majority of cops are now Hispanic, in particular Dominicans. There’s data out there that backs this up, I can find it, they just showed me over at the office. Over the last couple of years, there’s more opportunity for us and more recruitment for minorities to join which is a big step for the justice system fighting discrimination in all ways"</p>

			<h3>Overall</h3>
			<p>To recap, it is still true that Black and Latinos are being arrested on average more than any other race. However, for further research on the situation it is important to look at more cases and the specifics of each one. New York City is a very diverse city, and by default there are more minorities dominating the white majority that runs across the rest of the state of New York. </p>
			<p>Whether it is due to the neighborhood that an individual resides in, or the source of racism within the justice system, there is no definitive answer as to why the disparities continue, but it is crucial to make the public aware so that change can be heard and made.
